#Exercise 5.5 - Chomp Method The chomp method ensures that the puts line immediately after it
#doesn't end up going on two separate lines, in this case.

#puts "Hello there, and what\'s your name?"
#name = gets.chomp
#puts "Your name is " + name + "? What a lovely name!"
#puts "Pleased to meet you, " + name + ". :)"

#methods case
#letters = 'aAbBcCddeE'
#puts letters.upcase
#puts letters.downcase
#puts letters.swapcase
#puts letters.capitalize
#puts ' a'.capitalize
#puts letters
