		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Currently I am a recruiter for creative and technology professionals in Philadelphia, and I have worked on deepening my web design and development knowledge since 2010.  Previous to recruiting, I worked as a freelance production artist for print and digital projets in the Atlanta area and as a marketing coordinator for education non-profit organizations in New York City.  I started my coding journey when I had to change e-mail marketing templates for one of my non-profit positions. </p>
		<p>Since I moved to Philadelphia, I have taken courses with Girl Develop It! and Fleischer Art Memorial to deepen my coding and fine arts knowledge.</p>
		<h2>My Mission</h2>
		<p>Since I am self-taught, my goal with the General Assembly course is to pull my disparate knowledge together and to build a responsive digital portfolio.  Eventually I would like to work at an education or audio/video company to provide innovative solutions for individuals who want to learn or engage with cutting edge content.  I would like to primarily work in a front-end development or a hands-on product management capacity.</p>
